## Built with

* [Java SE 1.8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) - The development environment used

## MySQL Schema used

## Technical-Architectural Approach

The app was built with the intend of being properly maintanable and easily expandable. Therefore:
* __Data Access Object Design Pattern__ was used to isolate the data persistence logic in a separate layer
* __Composite Design Pattern__ was used for building the menu system to make adding/removing menu options and sub-menus straight-forward and easy, as well as make the whole menu system modular and flexible
* The user __status__ and __roles__, as well as the message __folders__ were placed in a separate table on our SQL schema, to allow easy addition of more (if any) in the future. The aim of the Java code was to be flexible and modular to follow this intent.

## Application acceptances - Notes
